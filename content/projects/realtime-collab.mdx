## Context

A rapidly scaling design platform needed multiplayer collaboration that felt instant and reliable across shaky networks.

## What I built

- Architected a CRDT-based document model with WebRTC signaling for low-latency sync.
- Added optimistic UI with conflict-free merges to keep collaborators aligned without visible jitter.
- Observability: traced payload sizes and applied adaptive batching to reduce chatter by 28%.

## Outcome

- 50k monthly active collaborators within 45 days of launch.
- Sync error rate down 32%, session duration up 18%.
