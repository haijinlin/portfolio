## Context

Ops teams were stuck exporting CSVs to answer routine questions. They needed curated, fast insights.

## What I built

- Next.js + Prisma API to power cohort, retention, and funnel tiles with cached queries.
- Componentized chart primitives with sensible defaults and guardrails for consistency.
- Permission-aware sharing to keep sensitive metrics scoped per team.

## Outcome

- Reporting time fell from hours to minutes; 60% drop in ad-hoc data requests.
- Stakeholder satisfaction (NPS) rose by 14 points after rollout.
